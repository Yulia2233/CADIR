## Import Surface

- top-level: `from simplecadapi import sweep_rsolid`

## Description

Create a solid by sweeping a profile along a path. Kernel history assigns
`sweep.start`, `sweep.end`, and `sweep.side` roles. Start and end tags require one
proven face each; side tags apply to all proven side faces. The generic
`output_tags` mapping accepts those full role names. `result_tag` targets the
solid, and recorded assignments are replayable semantic nodes.

Profiles with inner wires are rejected because the current PipeShell operation
receives only the outer wire; silently dropping profile holes is not allowed.
